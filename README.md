The live, production project can be found [here](https://firebolt55439.github.io/fanfic-downloader/web/).

## Fanfiction Modernized

The editor is minimalist and responsive, employing modern HTML5 and Javascript ES6 technologies now supported across all major browsers. Crucially, all work is done client-side, including EPUB packaging and ZIP file creation, as well as downloading (via HTML5 Blobs and CORS), eliminating unnecessary server calls entirely.

Warning: this downloader makes it all too easy to get addicted to fanfiction :).
