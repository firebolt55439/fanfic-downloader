The live, production project can be found [here](https://firebolt55439.github.io/fanfic-downloader/web/).

## Fanfiction Modernized

The editor is minimalist, responsive, and sleek, employing new HTML5 and Javascript ES6 technologies
now supported across all major browsers. All work is done client-side, including epub packaging and
zip file creation as well as downloading, using HTML5 Blobs, eliminating unnecessary server calls entirely.

Warning: this downloader makes it all too easy to get addicted to fanfiction :).
